    <h2>Our Grandfathers Fought A War In Korea
    </h2>
    <P>Our Grandfathers Fought A War Korea is a collection of digital collages created from photos my grandfather and his war buddies had taken during their time in the Korean War. The collages depict the way he often described his time in the service and the ways we often remember things in general, grimy, jumbled, and often saturated with emotion rather than detail. My grandfather was an immigrant fighting a war for a country that hardly ever embraced him, and the Korean War played an important role in his perspective on life, opportunity, family, and relationships, just like other veterans in our country.

    </P>
